        <img src="../images/Ramen.jpg" alt="Ramen from naruto">
        <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish that's widely popular in Japan and throughout the world. Though there are thousands of variations, the dish consists of a broth base, long thin noodles made from wheat, and an assortment of toppings.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Packages of Top Ramen</li>
            <li>About 5 cups of pork or beef broth (You can use the stuff in a box, the stuff in a can, or the cubes or the paste)</li>
            <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Baby bok choy (If you dont have bok choy you can use spinach instead</li>
            <li>1 Green onion</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li><strong><em>Optional</em></strong></li>
            <li>Aburage - that's those brown sticks on the right side of the bowl, it's a type of soy product that's used when you make inari-zushi.</li>
            <li>Nori - I forgot to put this is mine, but it's those black/green sheets sticking out of the back.</li>
            <li>Kamaboko - This is that white thing with the pink swirl.  Its made of a sort of fish paste that is steamed into like a cake.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours.  You can use just soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want.  Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
            <li>Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring to a boil and cover with a lid.  It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs.  Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool.</li>
            <li>While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring it to a simmer.  You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste.</li>
            <li>Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the flavor packets.  Let that cook.</li>
            <li>Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori.  Itadakimasu!</li>
