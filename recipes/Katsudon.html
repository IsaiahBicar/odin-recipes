    <h1>Katsudon</h1>

    <p>Katsudon is basically katsu (a pork chop breaded with panko and fried) over rice with onion and egg. It was awesome, and it became my go-to choice whenever I went to a Japanese place-a fish-less, teriyaki-less haven. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice </li>
        <li>2 boneless pork chops (and a meat mallet)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten, for breading</li>
        <li>1 cup panko</li>
        <li>1/2   cup dashi stock (you can use chicken or vegetable stock if you can't get a hold of some dashi or dashi powder)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. mirin</li>
        <li>2 tsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1 small onion, sliced thin</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup peas (alternatively, you can top it with scallions/green onions, thinly sliced nori, sesame seeds, whole snowpeas, and any combination of any of these)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin heating up some oil in a deep pan on the stove.  About ½” of oil should do.  Alternatively, if you have a deep fryer and feel comfortable using it, go ahead a use that for the pork katsu.</li>
        <li>Use a meat mallet to pound the pork to about ¼” thick.</li>
        <li>Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, and dust them with the flour.</li>
        <li>Dip the pork chops in the beaten egg, and then coat them with the panko.</li>
        <li>Place the pork chops in the hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides.  Remove from the oil and set aside on a paper towel to drain.</li>
        <li>If you haven't already made your rice, start cooking it now,</li>
        <li>Add the stock, soy sauce, mirin and sugar to a pan (one big enough to hold both pork chops) and bring it to a simmer.  Add in the onions and cover the pan with a lid.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are translucent, slice the pork katsu, and carefully (as to keep the slices together, treating them as if it were still a whole cutlet) add it on top of the onions.</li>
        <li>Beat the remaining two eggs and pour them on top of the pork katsu.  Cover the pan with the lid.</li>
        <li>Begin portioning the rice into two bowls.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are done (still kind of jiggly and slimy looking, but definitely not liquid anymore.  If you’re squeamish about eggs, feel free to cook it a bit longer, but be careful not to allow the egg to become dry and fluffy), pick up the pan and slide/pour the sauce, onions, katsu, and egg onto the rice in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Top with peas or your choice of garnish.</li>
        <li>Reward yourself with this delicious meal</li>
